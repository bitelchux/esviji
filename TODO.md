# Must have

- hitting a wrong piece removes a life
- allow navigating in menus with the keyboard
- add a tutorial
- store current game in localStorage to continue on next launch

# Nice to have

- work offline
- sounds
- time to play modifies the turn score
- change the design to stop using Paris metro signs
- the piece is launched after a short while even if the player doesn't do anything
